                    We primarily work with ISO&nbsp;17025–accredited
                    laboratories such as SGS, Intertek, and national reference
                    labs (for example PCSIR). For specific markets, we can align
                    testing with your preferred lab or retailer requirements
                    where needed.

                    In most cases, yes. Many clients share retailer or
                    distributor specifications for grain size, colour, or
                    maximum levels for certain elements. We compare these with
                    our internal limits and adapt our QC checks and reporting so
                    your documentation aligns with what buyers expect.

                    Non-conforming batches are quarantined and never packed
                    under export-grade labels. Corrective actions (re-sieving,
                    re-grading, or rejection) are documented under our quality
                    system before the order is released.
