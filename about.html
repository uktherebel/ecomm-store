            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Founded to connect serious importers with consistent Himalayan
              salt supply.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="two-column">
            <p>
              Salterra Naturals launched after years spent supporting overseas
              spa builders and specialty retailers who struggled with
              inconsistent supply, poor packaging, and limited communication
              from ad-hoc exporters. We saw an opportunity to bring
              Western-style project management to an industry still dominated by
              informal brokers. Today, our small team operates between Lahore
              and Karachi, coordinating production with vetted factories in the
              Khewra region and managing export documentation under our own
              name.
            </p>
            <p>
              We keep operations intentionally focused: Himalayan salt lamps,
              tiles, bulk salt, bath goods, cooking slabs, and carved items.
              This focus lets us monitor quality deeply, negotiate favorable
              production slots, and consolidate mixed shipments without
              confusion. Many of our clients reorder multiple times per year,
              trusting us to keep SKUs compliant and on schedule.

                We work with a small, audited network instead of chasing the
                lowest open-market quote.

            <h2>Communication Style</h2>
            <p>
              You work directly with our operations managers — no handoffs to
              unknown brokers. We respond to enquiries within one business day,
              keep WhatsApp and email threads organized, and document every
              decision. Weekly recaps summarize production percentages, QC
              findings, and ETDs so your team can plan retail launches or spa
              builds with confidence.

            <h2>Responsibility & QC</h2>
            <p>
              Himalayan salt is fragile and heavy. We manage it accordingly:
              climate-controlled storage, moisture testing, independent weight
              checks, and redundant packaging. Before a shipment leaves Lahore,
              we photograph every pallet, capture seal numbers, and upload
              documentation to a shared drive. This discipline prevents claims
              and saves weeks during customs clearance.

            <p>
              Importers, spa and sauna builders, salt room contractors,
              food-service wholesalers, and Amazon-focused brands rely on us to
              curate SKUs, meet compliance requirements, and ship on time. Some
              partners use us as their outsourced product team — we photograph
              SKUs, build spec sheets, and coordinate packaging tailored to
              their markets.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
              Our roadmap centers on better digital documentation, on-site QC
              rooms with live streaming for clients, and additional finished
              goods that pair Himalayan salt with complementary materials like
              ceramics and botanicals. The goal stays the same: make
              Pakistan-based sourcing feel as structured as working with a
              domestic supplier.
